### Hi ðŸ‘‹

I am a second-year student in computer science at AGH UST.

- Recently won a hackathon with this project: [**Krakoskie-Obwarzanki**](https://github.com/taylor-swif/Krakoskie-Obwarzanki). I was responsible for most of the backend, which was built using FastAPI and MongoDB.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **functional programing (erlang and elixir)**
